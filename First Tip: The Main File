How do i Setup the Main File?

These are usually always the first lines of the main file

package de.syntaxjava.main;  -- Describes the path of the Main.java

import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;  -- Import Minecraft Java

public final class Main extends JavaPlugin {  -- Now Start with the Main Code ->



    @Override
    public void onEnable() {     
                                        -- This was written here between the { } happens when 
                                        the plugin is started. for example "System.out.println("Hello World!")" and then 
     }                                  "Hello World!" is sent in the console of the server when the plugin gets started.

   
    
    
    
   
   @Override                       
   public void onDisable() {
                                      -- onDisable is basically exactly the same, only what is 
                                      written between the {} only happens if the 
     }                                plugin gets deactivated.
   



} -- This is the closing bracket from the (public final class Main extends JavaPlugin) line above.



Now you have a working main file! Great! 
Here you have summarized the whole main file:


package de.syntaxjava.main;

import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;

public final class Main extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");

    }

    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        System.out.println("Bye World!");
    }
}
